# Demonstration of simple AWK programs

Each directory contains a single AWK executable - run.awk - and is designed to work with the 1000users.csv file which contains 1000 records of 6 different attributes of a user.

The directories also contain the output (output.csv) that would be generated from these programs.

You can generate this for yourself by running the following:

```
./run.awk ../1000users.csv > output.csv
```
